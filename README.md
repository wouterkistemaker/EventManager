# EventManagerX

A simple Java program to create and handle Events.
This is a forked version of [Wouter Kistermaker's work](https://github.com/wouterkistemaker).

The internal handling of events were improved, and [execution priorities](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fme%2Fwouterkistemaker%2Feventmanager%2FHandlerPriority.java)
have been added.
